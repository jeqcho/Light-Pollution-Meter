In recent years, many accessible light pollution measurement methods are introduced into citizen science, including using the smartphone as a photometer to measure the night sky brightness. In this contribution, we investigated the photometric response of different Android smartphones and explored using the Moon as a calibration standard. We confirmed that smartphones have different instrumental zero points, and the Moon shows promising potential as a calibration standard. We also identified gamma correction as a major obstacle for this field calibration method. An app is developed for this paper and is released as open-source.

## Features
- Smartphone photometry callibration from the Moon with techniques to combat saturation
- Light pollution measurement in mpsas using smartphone cameras
